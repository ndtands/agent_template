When to use reflection agents and much more.\\n\\n# What Is Reflection?\\n\\nReflection is a prompting strategy used to improve the quality and success rate of agents and similar AI systems. It involves prompting an LLM to reflect on and critique its past actions, sometimes incorporating additional external information such as tools and observations. [...] ![]()\\n\\nSo basically to achieve reflection in LLM based systems, we have multiple LLM agents. Some that generate content(Generative part of LLMs). Others that reflect on generated content and give constructive criticism that can then be used to optimize the next generation in the cycle to make the content better. Let‚Äôs take a look into the types of these reflection types we can work with. There may be many more approaches considering the type of publishing this article. Keep this in mind. [...] As the name suggests, this is the most basic form of reflection agents. In this setup we have two main LLM agents, one acting as the generator and the other acting as the reflector that criticizes the responses from the generator and suggests constructive feedback.\\n\\n![]()\\n\\nHope the image above gave you a glimpse into how reflection agents work from a basic reflection agents setup point of view.
